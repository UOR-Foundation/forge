// The probe: where a measurement is taken. It is deliberately the smallest thing in the design, because
// it runs on the hot path of the shell, the live frame and the kernel worker.
//
// Clock: performance.timeOrigin + performance.now(), in whole microseconds. performance.now() is monotonic
// and is not moved by the wall clock; adding timeOrigin puts the page, the frame and a worker, which each
// have their own origin, on one time line, so a span between two contexts is a plain subtraction.
// Resolution is what the browser grants: 5 us when the page is cross-origin isolated, 100 us otherwise
// (Chromium), more under fingerprinting protection. The value is rounded, never interpolated.
//
// Cost: a mark writes four numbers into a preallocated Float64Array. No allocation, no promise, no
// message, no storage on the hot path; the ring is drained once per turn. A mark that finds the ring full
// is counted in `dropped`, never written over an earlier one, so a span is never computed from a stale
// event. Nothing here can reach the network: this file imports nothing and calls no I/O.
//
// Capacity is 1,024 events a turn. The model's list functions run in an interpreter that recurses once
// per event, and in Node that overflows between 1,000 and 2,000 events; a turn records about 130 (the
// replay) to a few hundred (one paint per change). A turn that fills the ring says so in `dropped`.
