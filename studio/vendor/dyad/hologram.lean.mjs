// build and the typecheck apply them together. The measurements that chose them are in studio/PERFORMANCE.md.
//
// The first load is the home page and the composer; everything else arrives when it is asked for:
//  - every route but home is its own chunk, fetched on intent (a hover or touch of a link preloads it);
//  - the preview panel's Code, Publish, Configure, Security, Tests, Plan and Problems panels are chunks of
//    their own, behind a named loading state;
//  - the code highlighter's eighteen grammars load with the first highlighted block, not with the page;
//  - a language other than English loads when it is chosen;
//  - Monaco is fetched when an editor is first drawn, not at import (it was fetched on every page load).

// Routes whose page is a chunk of its own: [route file, import line, component name, module].
