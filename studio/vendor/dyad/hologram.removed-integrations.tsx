// hologram-forge (ours, not Dyad's; see VENDORED.md): the hosted services this product does not use.
// Vercel and Coolify deploy, Supabase and Neon host a database: each is an account on another company's
// server, and the product runs in the visitor's browser alone. The host already answers their channels
// "unavailable" (CommandRegistry); the shell's build resolves their screens here, so none is drawn and
// none of their sign-in links is in the bundle. Publishing is the Hologram section above the old one.
