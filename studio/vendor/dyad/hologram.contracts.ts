// dyad-prism (ours, not Dyad's; see VENDORED.md): the contracts, published to the page so the host
// can validate commands before effects and check its own answers.
//
// Dyad's renderer types every call it makes but validates no answer at runtime, so a handler that
// returns an object where the contract declares an array crashes a screen with "is not iterable" the
// first time a user opens it, far from the cause. The whole contract set is small and already in the
// bundle, so it is published here as {channel: output schema}: `shell/host.js` parses every answer
// against it and returns a typed refusal on disagreement. Input schemas are
// published separately so the host uses the imported contract before any effect.
