// The chat routes one idea onto every feature of a Prism model. The model writing an app writes its
// behavior as its JSON spec (prism.js SPEC_RULES), and beside it the rest of one prism/prompt/1: who
// the app is for and what they care about, the systems around it, what can go wrong and what answers it,
// how good is good enough, and the journeys through it. The builder projects the spec and these parts
// into every facet, so the full model is defined by the conversation, not left to defaults.
//
// The parts travel in a <prism-prompt> block, the prompt without its app (the spec is the app). They
// are checked with the builder's own rules (readPrompt, deriveModel), so a threat with neither a control
// nor an accepted risk, a journey step that names no rule, or a quality row outside ISO/IEC 25010 is
// refused with the builder's reason, as the spec's own issues are. What the model leaves out the
// builder derives from the spec.

# Route the idea onto every feature of the app
An app is a whole Prism model, not only its rules. After the <dyad-spec> block, write one <prism-prompt> block: JSON holding the rest of the app's prism/prompt/1, everything the spec does not say. Route what the user asked for onto each member; derive the rest from the rules, and leave out a member only when it adds nothing to what the rules imply.
- "goal": the goal in one sentence a developer would say.
- "pattern": ${Object.entries(PATTERNS).map(([k, p]) => `"${k}" (${p.standard})`).join(", ")}. A stateMachine also writes "machine": {"state": <the choice field holding the state>, "initial", "final": [...]}.
- "stakeholders": [{"name", "text", "concerns": [<concern names>]}], who the app is for; a Verifier is always added.
- "concerns": [{"name", "text", "model": one of ${MODEL_KINDS.join(", ")}}], what they care about.
- "components": [{"name", "text", "kind": one of ${COMPONENT_KINDS.join(", ")}}], the systems that send the app requests or read its answers.
- "threats": [{"name", "text", "stride": one of ${STRIDE.join(", ")}, "asset": one of ${ASSET_KEYS.join(", ")}, "likelihood": ${LIKELIHOOD.join("/")}, "impact": ${IMPACT.join("/")}, and either "control": {"name", "text", "evidence": [{"kind": one of ${EVIDENCE_KINDS.join(", ")}, "reference"}]} or "accepted": <why the risk is accepted>}]. Proof evidence names a guarantee by its id (INV-001 is the first). The threats every app has are added for you.
- "quality": [{"characteristic", "subcharacteristic", "requirement", "text", "measure", "measureText", "threshold": <whole number>}], ISO/IEC 25010:2023 pairs only: ${Object.entries(ISO25010).map(([c, s]) => `${c} (${s.join(", ")})`).join("; ")}.
- "journeys": [{"stakeholder", "steps": [<REQ-001 for the first rule, INV-001 for the first guarantee, otherwise, refuse>]}].
Rewrite the whole block when any part of it changes. Example: <prism-prompt>{"goal":"Charge a fair parking fee.","stakeholders":[{"name":"Driver","text":"Parks and pays the fee the app answers.","concerns":["Fair fee"]}],"concerns":[{"name":"Fair fee","text":"A free stay is never charged.","model":"quality"}],"threats":[{"name":"Overcharge","text":"A free stay is charged premium.","stride":"repudiation","asset":"answer","likelihood":"low","impact":"major","control":{"name":"Proved free stay","text":"Lean proves a zero-hour stay is never premium.","evidence":[{"kind":"proof","reference":"INV-001"}]}}],"journeys":[{"stakeholder":"Driver","steps":["REQ-001","otherwise"]}]}</prism-prompt>`;
