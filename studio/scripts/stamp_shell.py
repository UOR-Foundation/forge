"""Place the renderer's built output beside the shell, and stage the scaffold beside it.

The homepage is shell/index.html, projected by the core from the verified View; it references the
renderer's assets by fixed names (vendor/dyad/vite.shell.config.mts, ours). This script copies the Vite output
under shell/assets/, writes shell/404.html as a copy of the homepage so Pages answers a refresh on any
of the renderer's routes with the app (the router reads the URL), and stages the renderer's scaffold with a file list,
which the host creates apps from. Run after the Vite build: python3 scripts/stamp_shell.py
