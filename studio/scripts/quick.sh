# Not the acceptance boundary: `just vv` in the locked SDK image is, and CI runs it. These are the gates that
# need only Node and Python, so a parse error, a hand-typed colour, a stale pin or a broken contract is seen
# in seconds rather than after a CI run. A gate whose inputs are not installed here (the renderer's or the
# live frame's node_modules, a renderer build) is named as not run, never passed silently. A change under
# app/ is named too: proving the kernel needs the SDK image, so CI's bootstrap does it.
