// The Published gate: a published app draws what its live preview draws. The preview is the frame, React
// over shadcn/ui (shell/live/components.js); the published page is the template's page with the app's own
// card (site/card.html, card.css, card.mjs), which Forge writes beside templateCommit's files. Both come
// from one view (live-src/src/view.jsx): the card's markup is that view rendered at publish, one variant
// per state a node can be in, and card.mjs picks a variant per node from what the verified guest answers.
//
//   node tools/published_preview.mjs --check
//
// Claims (level build: validated here against an oracle, evidence not proof). On the RSVP fixture:
//   same screen   for every state checked (the defaults, every example, a grid over the fields, refused
//                 requests), the screen card.mjs composes from the card's variants is byte for byte the
//                 view rendered for that state, which is what the frame renders
//   guest decides the answer shown is the guest's: a guest that disagrees with the rules is shown as such,
//                 and no rule is lit; a page that did not verify shows no answer
//   card files    card.html is the default state in the surface slot, with no script and no style
//                 attribute (the page's policy hashes its styles); card.css keeps Tailwind's base layer
//                 inside the card and resets the page's own rules there; card.mjs is a module whose
//                 default export starts the card; the three fit a budget of 24 KB gzipped
//   one view      the frame and the card renderer are built from the same view.jsx (live_components --check)
